## Instructions

Please answer the following questions thoughtfully and completely. Your responses should demonstrate your understanding of Pygame and game development concepts covered in this activity.

## Question 1: Understanding the Game Loop

In both tutorials, you worked with a game loop that continuously runs while the game is active. Explain in your own words what the game loop does and why it is essential for game development. What would happen if we didn't have a loop?

## Question 2: Pygame's Role in Simplifying Game Development

Before using Pygame, creating games required handling low-level graphics, input, and timing manually. How does Pygame simplify the process of creating games? Provide an example from the tutorials (such as specific functions or features) that demonstrate how Pygame makes game development easier.

## Question 3: Event Handling vs. Continuous Input

In Tutorial 2 (Space Invaders), we used two different methods for handling user input: `handle_events()` and `handle_input()`. Explain the difference between these two approaches. Why do we check for spacebar presses in `handle_events()` but check for arrow key movement in `handle_input()`? When would you use each approach?

## Question 4: Module Organization and Code Structure

Tutorial 2 used three separate files (`main.py`, `game.py`, and `config.py`) instead of putting all code in a single file like Tutorial 1. Explain the benefits of organizing code this way. How does Pygame's structure work together with Python's module system to make game development more manageable? Give specific examples from Tutorial 2.

## Question 5: Your Experience with Game Development

Reflect on your experience working through these tutorials. What did you find most interesting or surprising about game development with Pygame? Did creating games help you understand programming concepts differently than other activities? What kind of game would you want to create if you had more time to work with Pygame?
